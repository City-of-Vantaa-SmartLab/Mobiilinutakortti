# Mobiilinutakortti

The application consists of three subprojects: backend, frontend and admin-frontend.
* Admin-frontend is used by the youth workers to handle registered members and their info. The QR code reading is also part of this.
* Frontend is the end user web application used by the youth to see information about the youth clubs and generate a personal QR code for checking in.
* Backend has endpoints for both frontends and for Suomi.fi identification. It uses PostgreSQL for database.

More detailed documentation is found in a README in respective directories of each project.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- NodeJS - v10
- PostgreSQL - v11 (seems to work with v10 also; some problems with v12)

**Only Docker is needed to run the app.** If you want to run backend locally, you'll need NodeJS and PostgreSQL installed. More info in ./backend/README.md.

## Technologies

- Frontend : React *(running on port 3001)*
- Backend : NestJS *(running on port 3000)*
- Admin-Frontend : React Admin *(running on port 5000)*
- Database : PostgreSQL *(running on port 5432)*

## Running the app

Each subproject may be run individually, with or without docker - see README.md files of the projects.
To start up everything using Docker compose, **run `docker-compose up` in this directory**.

To make sure everything is working, navigate to:
- [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) - frontend
- [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) - admin-frontend (default port will be 3000 if running without Docker)
- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/api) - backend

If you see the webpage for frontend and admin-frontend, and "API is running" message for backend, you're good.

NOTE:
* If you have PostgreSQL running locally, it is probably using port 5432 and will conflict with the Docker setup. Bring the local instance down or reconfigure it to solve the issue.
* Docker might not start all the services especially if you encounter some problems somewhere at any point. In this case, just **try to compose up again**.
* At some point during npm install you might get a weird error like this:

    npm ERR! code EAI_AGAIN
    npm ERR! errno EAI_AGAIN
    npm ERR! request to https://registry.npmjs.org/minimist/-/minimist-1.2.0.tgz failed, reason: getaddrinfo EAI_AGAIN registry.npmjs.org registry.npmjs.org:443

    This is because Docker has some problems using IPv6 DNS servers. Force the use of IPv4 DNS in your localhost.

## Creating an admin user

The application needs at least one admin user to work properly. The backend must be running when executing this step.

### Use curl

Run the following `curl` command to create an admin user

```bash
curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/api/admin/registerTemp' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "email": "test@test.com",
    "password": "test",
    "firstName": "admin",
    "lastName": "admin",
    "isSuperUser": "true"
}'
```

### Use other tools
---

Alternatively, you can use GUI tools such as Postman or Insomnia to create an admin user.

POST toÂ [http://localhost:3000/api/admin/registerTemp](http://localhost:3000/api/admin/registerTemp) with following body:

```json
{
    "email":"test@test.com",
    "password": "test",
    "firstName": "admin",
    "lastName": "admin",
    "isSuperUser": "true"
}
```

Now you can login to admin-frontend with given credentials.

## Troubleshooting

Docker volumes sometimes get messed up and database won't work, often indicated by login not working. This might be indicated by error message such as:

`Failed Password Authentication for user 'postgres'`

Bring down the Docker containers with: `docker-compose down`

To nuke the database, remove Docker volume from the PostgreSQL container, and bring the application up again.
